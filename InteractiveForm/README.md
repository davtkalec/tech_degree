Full Stack JavaScript developers create forms to collect information from users for nearly every website and application they build. 
For this project, you’ll use your skills to enhance a form so that it’s engaging, interactive, and easy to use.
Form cannot be submitted (the page does not refresh when the submit button is clicked) until the following requirements have been met:
Name field isn’t blank.
Email field contains validly formatted e-mail address: (doesn’t have to check that it's a real e-mail address, just that it's formatted like one: dave@teamtreehouse.com, for example).
At least one checkbox under "Register for Activities" section must be selected.
If "Credit Card" is the selected payment option, the three fields accept only numbers: a 13 to 16-digit credit card number, a 5-digit zip code, and 3-number CVV value.
